                    <p>QuaDs was my first game that's ever released. It has a colorful and musical gameplay that was (still is) trendy amongst mobile games. I started working on QuaDs in my last year of highschool and finished one year later, the game was then released to Google Play in January, 2017.</p>
                    <p>The engine used was GameMaker Studio, it uses GML (GameMaker Language) which is very similar to Javascript. All in-game assets were made by me. The most challenging part however was the sound, where I had to slice songs into notes, which then plays as the player taps in the game.</p>
                    <p>Another obstable was exposure, setting up a budget to spend on advertising was nowhere near cost-effective. Fortunately, a post I made about the game on social media site 9gag.com gained some popularity and this drove nearly all the downloads for my game.</p>
