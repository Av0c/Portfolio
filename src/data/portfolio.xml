            <h1>QuaDs - A Musical Tap Game</h1>
            <p>QuaDs was my first game that's ever released. I started working on it in my last year of highschool and finished one year later, the game was then released to Google Play at the start of 2017.</p>
            <p>The engine used was GameMaker Studio, it uses GML (GameMaker Language) which is very similar to Javascript. All in-game assets were made by me. The most challenging part however was the sound, where I had to slice songs into notes, which then plays as the player taps in the game.</p>
